# What is _Among Digitized Manuscripts_ ?
This is the repository for the book by L.W. Cornelis van Lit, to be published by Brill in 2019 under the title _Among Digitized Manuscripts: Philology, Codicology, Palaeography in a Digital World_. See also [here](https://digitalorientalist.github.io/Among-Digitized-Manuscripts/)

## Contents
This handbook provides a conceptual and practical toolbox for anybody working with digital photos of texts rather than the artifact itself (or the plain text contents of it). The core question it answers is, now that we have digitized such a dizzying amount of manuscripts, what to do with it? In short, the chapters discuss the following topics:
1.	The difference between a text existing in a material manuscript, a printed publication, or a digital document.
2.	What happens when we have a hybrid form: a material manuscript represented as a digital document? And, in particular, how can we describe and evaluate the digital aspects of a digitized manuscript?
3.	The application of such an evaluation to twenty leading repositories, to better understand the variety of digitization we can encounter.
4.	Arguing for self-sufficiency and small-scale use of technology since large projects tend to die ungracefully. This chapter also includes instructions how to redraw glyphs as vector shapes to assist in advanced analysis.
5.	Describes the workflow from getting the textual content out of a manuscript into a computer, and all the perils involved. 
6.	Using web development technology to publish results both interactively and graphically. I discuss this by detailing from start to finish how to catalog an uncatalogued collection.
7.	Learning to program, specifically with Python. Readers will be introduced to writing custom image recognition and analysis software.
8.	In the conclusion I once more make a case for the self-sufficient humanities scholar who can use technology to their own liking and I further argue that what is now perceived as a division between ‘digital humanities’ and ‘classical humanities’ would ideally cease to be as digital methods become part and parcel of our daily workflow.
- There is also a *Postscript* in which I share some of my own experience working with digitized manuscripts, including an explanation of the title of the book.

### ```Among```
There is also ```Among```; an overarching project to apply computer technology to the study of manuscripts, of which the above-mentioned book is just one part. ```Among``` is a collaboration, a place to come together and discuss, perhaps even a movement.
